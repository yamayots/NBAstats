# NBAstats
Currently looking for access to raw NBA game data from the past 20 years. I would prefer not to pay any money to download data because this is more of a personal project. Looking for data in excel, csv, or anything really. Going to use R to manipulate data for my own personal analysis! 

Thanks in advanced! #Kags
